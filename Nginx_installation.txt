At this point we have working web app to stream live video on local network 

to stream online globally we are going to use Nginx.

it is not install on raspberry pi by default 

in terminal-->type-->sudo apt install nginx
		 --> type cd  /etc/nginx/sites-available	
		--> sudo nano default
		--> proxy pass htpp://localhost:5000/index.html

in order for our website to be availabe to outside world we need our ip address
-->google what is my IP address and it will come up
--> noip.com -> create hostname
-->go to router-->portforward to local raspberry pi IP addresss
